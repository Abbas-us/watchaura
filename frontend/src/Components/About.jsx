                    <p>The idea for The Watch Pages came about because people often asked us for advice about which watch they should buy. The more this happened—and it happened a lot—the more we realized that searching for a watch online is a minefield of information. Leveraging our 20 years of experience working in the watch industry, we understood the intricacies and nuances of selecting the perfect watch.

The individual brand websites are great, but there are hundreds of watch brands in Switzerland alone, so checking out each page individually would take you weeks, and that’s if you know the names of all the brands.
